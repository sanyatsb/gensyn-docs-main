# RL Swarm
RL Swarm is a peer-to-peer system for reinforcement learning. It allows you to train a model collaboratively with other models in the swarm, leveraging their collective intelligence. It is open source and permissionless, meaning you can run it on a consumer laptop at home or on a powerful GPU in the cloud. You can also connect your model to the Gensyn Testnet, to receive an on-chain identity that tracks your progress over time
You can see the stats of the swarm that is currently running [here![](./gensyn-md/assets/5f3b0eaf470bccede74bcc771dbb7a7296dec3f4.svg)](https://dashboard.gensyn.ai/). Soon you will be able to create your own swarm, and eventually connect multiple swarms together to train powerful models across domains
