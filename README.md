Welcome to the official Gensyn docs. Here you'll find information on Gensyn, including how it works, what you can build with it, and how to get started today.\
\
Gensyn is a protocol for machine learning computation. It provides a standardised way to execute machine learning tasks across any device in the world. This allows us to aggregate the world's computing supply into a single network, which can support AI systems at far greater scale than is possible today. It is fully open source and permissionless, meaning anyone can contribute to the network or use it.

It consists of the following components:\\

* a framework for **consistent ML execution,** ensuring compatibility across any device;
* a **trustless verification** syste&#x6D;**,** checking and agreeing on work performed in a scalable way;
* a **peer-to-peer communication** metho&#x64;**,** sharing workloads between devices over the internet; and
* a **decentralised coordination** layer, identifying participants, aligning incentives, and executing payments permissionlessly.

The underlying coordination system is a custom blockchain (Ethereum rollup), which will support a broad ecosystem of complementary applications to push the frontier of open machine intelligence.
